    Abstract={Business process management has received considerable attention and many companies achieved a high maturity level and hence, generated collections of process models that form a knowledge asset essential to their operations. These collections bear opportunities for innovation: Empirical research establishes methods and techniques to support and improve business process management; yet, these need to be validated with regards to process models from industry. However, due to their heterogeneity, extracting and analyzing process models from process model collections is a tedious task and time consuming.},

abstract="Workflow management systems facilitate the everyday operation of business processes by taking care of the logistic control of work. In contrast to traditional information systems, they attempt to support frequent changes of the workflows at hand. Therefore, the need for analysis methods to verify the correctness of workflows is becoming more prominent. In this chapter we present a method based on Petri nets. This analysis method exploits the structure of the Petri net to find potential errors in the design of the workflow. Moreover, the analysis method allows for the compositional verification of workflows.",
