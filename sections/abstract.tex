Modeling techniques in Business Process Management (BPM) often suffer from low
adoption due to the variety of profiles found in organizations. This project
aims to provide a novel alternative to BPM documentation with \emph{Annotated
  Textual Descriptions} (ATD). ATD are based on text annotations, which can be
understood by non-technical users, but are still a robust alternative for
business process automation.


In order to deploy ATD-based solutions in BPM systems, the ATD reference
implementation, \emph{ATDlib}, has been developed as part of this project. The
current implementation is able to parse and manage ATD, automatically generate 
annotations, and convert ATD into other business process representations. 

Finally, a practical application of ATD, the \emph{Model Judge}, is presented.
Model Judge is a web platform that can students learn to model business
processes and guide them with accurate diagnostics. The tool has been tested in
two pilot university courses and the anlytics information collected during the
sessions has been analysed.
