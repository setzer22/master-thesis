This Master Thesis would have not been possible without the invaluable
collaboration of many people. I want to thank everyone for their support and all
the good ideas that have arisen as part of this project.

First of all, I would like to acknowledge my advisors, Josep Carmona and Llu\'is
Padr\'o, for their feedback and support, and also for the opportunity they have
given me to work in their department as a research assistant, and as a future
Ph.D. student to continue the work we started in this thesis. Special thanks go
as well to all my colleagues from the office, the \emph{NLP4BPM} project, and
especially to Lu\'is Delicado, for his work on \emph{Model Judge}.

Part of the work presented is the fruit of collaboration between our research
group and two other universities, Denmark's Technical Univeristy (DTU) and the
Universidad Cat\'olica de Santa Mar\'ia. I want to thank Barbara
Weber, Andrea Burattin, Amine Abbad and Guillermo Calder\'on for their feedback,
ideas and for running the two Model Judge pilot courses in their universities. 

And last, but not least, I want to give special thanks to my parents for their
invaluable support. Also my family, friends and of course Montse,
who stood next to me during this long journey.
