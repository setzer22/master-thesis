\chapter{Describing Processes with Natural Language}
\label{cha:atd}

\section{Annotated Textual Descriptions}

In order to support the efficient creation and communication of business
processes, we aim to define a notation that is close to the mental framework of
the actors involved in th eprocess. We strongly believe natural language
descriptions to be an easy system to communicate process information. However,
natural language alone suffers from ambiguity, and its unstructured nature
makes automatic processing difficult and unreliable. In order to solve this,
while still providing a flexible way of describing processes, we rely on
annotations (See Section~\ref{sec:background_anns})


- Present ATDs as a PM notation
- Characteristics
  - Can model ambiguity (flexible)
  - Open-world assumption: What's not explicit could be anything
  - Little representational bias 
  - Declarative 
  - Rich semantics: Not only process flow
  
- Requirements
  - Must be able to represent everything that we need
  - Ergonomics: Easy to annotate, no "boilerplate" (thanks to reasoning)

- Motivate the need for annotations vs plain text:
  - Some things cannot be inferred w/o domain knowledge
  - NLP state-of-the-art can't accurately annotate text like we want to, this
  intermediate step helps add structure, and also presents a format to create
  future datasets.

\section{ATD Semantics}

- Describe basic building blocks: Annotations, Relations
  
\subsection{Annotation Types}

- Action
  - Optional
  - ...
 
- Role
  - Person
  - Computer System?

- Object
  - Data Store
  - ...

- Condition / Event


\subsection{Relation Types}

- Agent, Patient

- Coreferences

- Control Flow

- ...

\subsection{Automatic Reasoning}

- Inferring order relationships / transitive closure

- More complex problems (e.g. soundness?)
